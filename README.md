**Live demo:** [https://resume-tailor-at9k.onrender.com](https://resume-tailor-at9k.onrender.com)

Resume Tailor is an AI-powered web app that helps job seekers **optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions**.  
It parses your resume, extracts your skills, compares them to keywords from a job description, and gives tailored feedback — so you know exactly what to improve before applying.
